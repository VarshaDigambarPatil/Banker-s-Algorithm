# Banker-s-Algorithm
Introduction
Deadlock is a critical issue in operating systems, especially in resource allocation among concurrent processes. The Banker's Algorithm, developed by Edsger Dijkstra, is a classic algorithm used to avoid deadlock by ensuring that the system is always in a safe state.

This project demonstrates a dynamic, interactive web-based implementation of the Banker’s Algorithm. It allows users to simulate the algorithm by entering the number of processes, resources, allocations, and maximum needs, then evaluating the system’s safety.
